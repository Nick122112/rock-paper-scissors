I created a rock, paper, scissors game that prompts the user to type their choice, randomly generates a computer choice, and logs the winner of the round and the current score to the console. Once the user or computer reaches a score of 5, the game ends and the winner is logged to the console. This project taught me how to divide projects up into different steps. First, I need to create the prompt for the user to make their choice. Then, I needed to generate a random computer choice. After that, I needed to determine a winner based on the two choices. Finally, I needed to loop this situation until the user or computer won 5 rounds. This project helped me think more logically and practice important Javascript fundamentals such as functions and loops.
